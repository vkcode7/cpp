### What is the SOFR Rate?
The SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is a benchmark interest rate for U.S. dollar-denominated loans and derivatives. It reflects the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repo market.

#### Key Features of SOFR
- Secured: Based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasuries.
- Overnight: Represents the cost of overnight borrowing.
- Transaction-Based: Derived from actual market transactions rather than estimates, making it robust and transparent.
- Risk-Free: Considered nearly risk-free due to the U.S. Treasury collateral.

SOFR was introduced as an alternative to LIBOR, which was phased out due to concerns about its reliability and susceptibility to manipulation.
